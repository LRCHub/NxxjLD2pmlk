[00:33.91] City's breaking down on a camel's back
[00:37.03] They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
[00:40.50] So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
[00:43.82] You won't get out the country 'cause you're bad and free
[00:47.23] You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
[00:50.84] A melancholy town where we never smile
[00:54.54] And all I wanna hear is the message beep
[00:57.71] My dreams, they've got to kiss me
[00:59.66] Because I don't get sleep, no
[01:14.16] 
[01:05.18] Windmill, windmill for the land
[01:08.36] Turn forever hand in hand
[01:11.89] Take it all in on your stride
[01:15.17] It is ticking, falling down
[01:19.15] Love forever, love is free
[01:21.78] Let's turn forever, you and me
[01:25.74] Windmill, windmill for the land
[01:28.92] Is everybody in?
[01:36.92] 
[01:35.52] Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
[01:37.98] Lining 'em up like ass cracks
[01:39.77] Play these ponies at the track
[01:41.44] It's my chocolate attack
[01:43.06] Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
[01:45.05] Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
[01:46.54] Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[01:49.60] Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
[01:51.76] With yo' sound, you in the blink
[01:53.41] Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
[01:55.17] With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
[01:56.93] So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
[01:59.18] Until you're cheddar head (yeah)
[02:00.51] And watch the way I navigate
[02:02.04] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[02:09.04] 
[02:04.12] Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, feel good
[02:07.51] Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, feel good
[02:11.16] Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, feel good
[02:14.56] Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da, feel good
[02:32.56] 
[02:39.05] Windmill, windmill for the land
[02:41.81] Turn forever hand in hand
[02:45.57] Take it all in on your stride
[02:48.72] It is ticking, falling down
[02:52.69] Love forever, love is free
[02:55.53] Let's turn forever, you and me
[02:59.22] Windmill, windmill for the land
[03:02.47] Is everybody in?
[03:10.47] 
[03:09.89] Don't stop, get it, get it
[03:11.60] Peep how your captain's in it
[03:13.41] Steady, watch me navigate
[03:14.92] Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[03:16.32] Don't stop, get it, get it
[03:18.40] Peep how your captain's in it
